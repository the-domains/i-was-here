            <title><![CDATA[☁️ On cloud 9 ☁️ ******************************************* Without a doubt, Bali is one of the best (and cheapest) places to unwind, relax and focus on your wellness. Nearly every day, after class at @InstituteofCode, I've gotten an hour-long massage for -- wait for it -- $5.95. Homemade kombucha, fresh juice and organic eats are available around every corner. And, along with taking extra care of my body, I've also gone above and beyond for my skin. One of the best spas in Bali, @cocoonmedicalspa, treated me to microdermabrasion and a super hydrating oxygen facial to help me recover from my 25-hour travel day to Bali. Even the best spas here are a fraction of the price you'd pay back home without compromising care or quality. So, that being said, I think I should just stay here forever. For my health of course. 😉💆🏼🕉 ******************************************* #balisunset #bali #balidaily #baliadvisor #canggu]]></title>
